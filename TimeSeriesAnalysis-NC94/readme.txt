Code is present in the file t_series.py. As the data files are large, they are not included in the zip. The files climate.txt and crop.txt are required for this.
To run it, type on terminal:
	$ python3 t_series.py

Some dependencies like tslearn, sklearn, pandas, numpy etc might need to be installed if not already present.

Note: For continuous execution of the program, close all matplotlib windows as they pop up.
